      "- **Result:** Ages of **≈ 4.567 billion years** (Jacobsen et al., 2008).  \n",

      "### 8. Why Earth’s age differs slightly from the Sun’s  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sun’s age:** Determined from **helioseismology and solar‑model fitting**, which give **≈ 4.57 billion years** (Bahcall et al., 2001).  \n",
      "- **Difference:** ≈ 30 million years.  \n",
      "- **Reason:** After the Sun ignited, dust grains needed time to coalesce into planetesimals and eventually the Earth. The ~30 Ma offset reflects this accretion interval.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. Historical development of the Earth‑age estimate  \n",
      "\n",
      "| Era | Typical age estimate | Reason for change |\n",
      "|-----|----------------------|-------------------|\n",
      "| Early 20th century | **2–3 billion years** | Limited radiometric techniques; reliance on geological assumptions |\n",
      "| 1950s–1960s | **≈ 3.5 billion years** | Improved U–Pb methods and discovery of older minerals (e.g., early zircons) pushed estimates upward |\n",
      "| 1970s onward | **≈ 4.5 billion years** | High‑precision U–Pb dating of meteorites, Jack Hills zircons, and mantle rocks; convergence of multiple isotopic systems |\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 1970s the **4.5‑billion‑year** figure has remained stable, reflecting the maturity of the underlying methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion  \n",
      "\n",
      "All of the independent evidence—**U–Pb ages of chondritic meteorites, lunar and Martian rocks, Jack Hills zircons, Pb–Pb mantle isochrons, and concordant astrophysical models**—converge on a single, tightly constrained age for our planet:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\boxed{\\text{Earth age} = 4.54 \\pm 0.05 \\text{ billion years}}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Note:** This age refers to the time when Earth’s bulk material accreted and the planet’s mantle and crust solidified. The exact moment of core formation is constrained by the Re‑Os system to be within the same ~100 Ma interval, but is not directly represented by the quoted figure.\n",
