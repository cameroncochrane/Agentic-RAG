      "| Reaction class | Why it is important in total synthesis | Representative examples |\n",
      "|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n",
      "| **Multicomponent reactions (MCRs)** – Mannich, Passerini, Ugi, Biginelli, etc. | Provide rapid, convergent access to highly functionalized intermediates, dramatically shortening synthetic sequences. | MCRs are employed to construct alkaloid cores and peptidomimetic natural products [L‑0001]. |\n",
      "| **(Intramolecular) Diels‑Alder (IMDA) and tandem Diels‑Alder (TADA) cycloadditions** | Pericyclic reactions that forge multiple C–C bonds and stereocenters in a single step, enabling the construction of polycyclic frameworks typical of terpenoids, alkaloids and polyketides. | IMDA and TADA cyclizations are widely used to build polycyclic terpenoid and alkaloid frameworks [L‑0002, L‑0004]. |\n",
      "| **Radical‑mediated transformations** – especially tandem intramolecular cyclization‑alkylation | Allow C–C bond formation under mild, often neutral conditions; the radical nature tolerates diverse functional groups and can generate strained or congested motifs that are difficult to access by polar pathways. | Radical cyclization‑alkylation sequences have been applied to assemble complex carbon skeletons in natural‑product targets [L‑0003]. |\n",
      "| **Sonogashira cross‑coupling** | A versatile palladium‑copper mediated C–C bond‑forming reaction that efficiently installs conjugated alkyne (enyne) fragments, supporting convergent assembly of highly unsaturated natural products. | Sonogashira coupling efficiently installs enyne motifs in natural‑product targets [L‑0005]. |\n",
      "| **Photoredox catalysis** | Uses visible light to generate radicals in a controlled, mild fashion, opening new disconnections for the construction of strained rings, heterocycles and densely functionalized scaffolds. | Photoredox‑driven radical processes enable the synthesis of highly functionalized natural‑product architectures [L‑0006]. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Multicomponent Reactions (MCRs)  \n",
      "MCRs combine three or more building blocks in a single operation, delivering complex, highly functionalized intermediates that can be directly elaborated into natural‑product targets. This efficiency makes them among the most valuable tools in modern synthesis [L‑0001].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Intramolecular & Tandem Diels‑Alder Cycloadditions  \n",
      "The intramolecular Diels‑Alder (IMDA) and tandem Diels‑Alder (TADA) reactions are cornerstone pericyclic strategies for assembling six‑membered carbocycles and polycyclic skeletons found in many natural‑product families. Their concerted nature sets multiple stereocenters in one step, providing excellent stereochemical control [L‑0002, L‑0004].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Radical‑Mediated Transformations  \n",
      "Tandem intramolecular cyclization‑alkylation sequences enable the construction of carbon frameworks under gentle conditions, often tolerating sensitive functional groups and delivering intricate architectures with high efficiency [L‑0003].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Sonogashira Coupling  \n",
      "This palladium‑copper cross‑coupling efficiently joins aryl or vinyl halides with terminal alkynes, furnishing enyne fragments that are prevalent in bioactive natural products and allowing convergent, late‑stage functionalization [L‑0005].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Photoredox Catalysis  \n",
      "Visible‑light‑driven photoredox processes have emerged as a powerful platform for generating radicals in a controlled manner, enabling the assembly of strained or highly functionalized structures that were previously inaccessible or required harsh conditions [L‑0006].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion  \n",
      "The reactions that dominate contemporary natural‑product synthesis are those that combine **high step economy**, **stereochemical precision**, and **functional‑group tolerance**. Accordingly, the most important classes are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Multicomponent reactions [L‑0001]  \n",
      "- Intramolecular/tandem Diels‑Alder cycloadditions [L‑0002, L‑0004]  \n",
      "- Radical‑mediated cyclizations [L‑0003]  \n",
      "- Sonogashira cross‑couplings [L‑0005]  \n",
      "- Photoredox‑catalyzed transformations [L‑0006]  \n",
      "\n",
